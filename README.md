# Prediction of Online Popularity

Project as part of Stanford MS&E 226: "Small Data: Prediction, Inference, Causality".

Authors: Guillaume Chhor, Simon Hagege

In this project, we try to address the challenge of predicting online news popularity based on some features extracted from the article itself. This kind of analysis can be useful for so- cial companies in order to asses which articles should be high- lighted in the newsfeed. In the first part of the project, we will describe the content of our dataset, notably spotting potential issues resulting from missing values and looking at statistics on the dataset across categorical variables as well as pairwise correlations between our variables. Building upon this data ex- ploration, in the second part we will design our best model for classification and regression after having got rid of collinear covariates, logtransformed some of our variables, done feature selection using model scores and looked at interaction with cat- egorical variables. For both of these tasks, we gave an estimate of the test error for each models, including a baseline defined beforehand, using cross validation and chose the best model accordingly. In this third part we will the test error of our best model for classification and regression, analyze a linear regres- sion model from an inference perspective and finally discuss some applications of and improvements that can be brought to our model.
